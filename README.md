# Baseball-Dashboard

This is a website for visualizing baseball data. It allows you to view scatter plots for the stats of your choosing. For example, below you can see a scatter plot showing all teams this season based on their wRC+ versus Barrel%.

![wRC+ vs Barrel%](https://baseball.asir.dev/media/76f6cdc028d8719192f44385fbb26a5efabe730796a3aa741c7bc351.png)

I was looking for websites that allow you to easily create graphs like these, but I couldn't find any. So I figured I might as well create one myself.

The data is provided by [pybaseball](https://pypi.org/project/pybaseball/) and [Fangraphs](https://www.fangraphs.com/). The plots are generated using [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/))
