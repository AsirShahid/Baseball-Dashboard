# Baseball-Dashboard

This is a website for visualizing baseball data. It allows you to view scatter plots for the stats of your choosing. For example, below you can see a scatter plot showing all qualified players this season based on their Homeruns versus Barrel%.

I was looking for websites that allow you to easily create graphs like these, but I couldn't find any. So I figured I might as well create one myself.

The data is provided by [pybaseball](https://pypi.org/project/pybaseball/) and the plots are generated using [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/))
